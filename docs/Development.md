## Code Structure Recommendations

### Frontend Organization

The frontend code should be organized as follows:

#### Component Structure
- Atomic design pattern for UI components
- Container/Presenter pattern for separation of concerns
- Custom hooks for reusable logic

#### State Management
- React Context for global state
- Redux for complex state management
- Local component state for UI-specific state

#### Code Example: Component Structure
```jsx
// src/components/Terminal/Terminal.jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useGameContext } from '../../contexts/GameContext';
import TerminalInput from './TerminalInput';
import TerminalOutput from './TerminalOutput';
import './Terminal.css';

const Terminal = ({ initialCommands = [] }) => {
  const [history, setHistory] = useState(initialCommands);
  const [currentCommand, setCurrentCommand] = useState('');
  const { executeCommand } = useGameContext();

  const handleCommandSubmit = async (command) => {
    setHistory([...history, { type: 'input', content: command }]);
    const result = await executeCommand(command);
    setHistory([...history, { type: 'output', content: result }]);
    setCurrentCommand('');
  };

  return (
    <div className="terminal">
      <TerminalOutput history={history} />
      <TerminalInput 
        value={currentCommand}
        onChange={setCurrentCommand}
        onSubmit={handleCommandSubmit}
      />
    </div>
  );
};

export default Terminal;
```

### Backend Organization

The backend code should be organized as follows:

#### API Structure
- RESTful endpoints for resource operations
- WebSocket handlers for real-time communication
- Middleware for authentication and validation

#### Service Layer
- Business logic separated from routes
- Reusable services for common operations
- Dependency injection for testability

#### Code Example: API Route
```javascript
// src/api/challenges.js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const { authenticateUser } = require('../middleware/auth');
const ChallengeService = require('../services/ChallengeService');

// Get all challenges
router.get('/', authenticateUser, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const challenges = await ChallengeService.getAllChallenges(req.user.id);
    res.json(challenges);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});

// Get challenge by ID
router.get('/:id', authenticateUser, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const challenge = await ChallengeService.getChallengeById(req.params.id, req.user.id);
    if (!challenge) {
      return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Challenge not found' });
    }
    res.json(challenge);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});

module.exports = router;
```

### Shared Code

Shared code between client and server should be organized as follows:

#### Constants
- Game configuration
- Error messages
- Event types

#### Types
- TypeScript interfaces for shared data structures
- Enums for game states and actions

#### Utilities
- Validation functions
- Helper functions
- Formatters and parsers

#### Code Example: Shared Types
```typescript
// shared/types/challenge.ts
export interface Challenge {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  difficulty: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced' | 'expert';
  type: 'network' | 'web' | 'crypto' | 'forensics' | 'reverse';
  points: number;
  timeLimit?: number; // in seconds, optional
  prerequisites?: string[]; // IDs of prerequisite challenges
}

export interface UserChallenge extends Challenge {
  completed: boolean;
  completedAt?: Date;
  attempts: number;
  bestScore?: number;
}
```

### Module Patterns

The following module patterns are recommended:

#### Feature-Based Organization
- Group related components, services, and utilities by feature
- Maintain clear boundaries between features
- Use index files for clean exports

#### Dependency Management
- Use dependency injection for testability
- Minimize direct dependencies between modules
- Use interfaces for loose coupling

#### Code Example: Feature Module
```
features/
└── terminal/
    ├── components/
    │   ├── Terminal.jsx
    │   ├── TerminalInput.jsx
    │   └── TerminalOutput.jsx
    ├── hooks/
    │   └── useTerminalHistory.js
    ├── services/
    │   └── terminalCommands.js
    ├── utils/
    │   └── parseCommand.js
    └── index.js
```

- Implement proper error handling

#### Code Example: Secure WebSocket Setup
```javascript
// server/src/websocket/index.js
const WebSocket = require('ws');
const https = require('https');
const fs = require('fs');
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const { JWT_SECRET } = require('../config');

// Create HTTPS server
const server = https.createServer({
  cert: fs.readFileSync('path/to/cert.pem'),
  key: fs.readFileSync('path/to/key.pem')
});

// Create WebSocket server
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ server });

// Handle connections
wss.on('connection', function connection(ws, req) {
  // Authenticate connection
  const token = new URL(`wss://${req.headers.host}${req.url}`).searchParams.get('token');
  
  try {
    const decoded = jwt.verify(token, JWT_SECRET);
    ws.userId = decoded.userId;
    
    // Handle messages
    ws.on('message', function incoming(message) {
      try {
        const data = JSON.parse(message);
        // Validate message structure
        if (!data.type || !data.payload) {
          return ws.send(JSON.stringify({ error: 'Invalid message format' }));
        }
        
        // Process message based on type
        handleMessage(ws, data);
      } catch (error) {
        ws.send(JSON.stringify({ error: 'Invalid message' }));
      }
    });
  } catch (error) {
    ws.close(1008, 'Authentication failed');
  }
});

server.listen(8080);
```
